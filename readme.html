COPASI, free software, is required for this model and is available,
along with documentation, from <a href="http://www.copasi.org/">http://www.copasi.org/</a>
  <p/>
  Example Usage:<br/>
  --------------<br/>
  Start COPASIUI and open model_treatment.cps. Select Time Course and click on Run. You should see a graph of Ca2+ generated:<p/>

  The figures in the paper are the mean results from hundreds 
of single runs. The screen shot reproduces a single 
run of the model. Supplementary figure S2, first column (A to E) shows 
the example of 5 single runs. The first column of Fig. S2 panel F shows 
the mean result of hundred simulations. We used the Condor Copasi 
  platform to do it automatically:
